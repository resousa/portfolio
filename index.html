                I have lived in the state of Washington for the past 8 years. Before that I grew up in Dayton, OH, and
                spent
                some time in
                Las Vegas while attending University of Nevada Las Vegas. I currently live in West Seattle with my wife
                Lindsay and my dog
                Toby. I really enjoy making models, watching/palying baskeball, and hiking with my wife and dog. Since
                moving to Washington
                I have had jobs as a finish carpenter, CAD designer, and most recently facilities manager.

                Coding has always intrigured me. I had spent some time in the past playing around on codecademy and
                really
                enjoyed it. After
                I saw this class being offered I was really excited to give it a shot. I have really enjoyed the class
                so
                far, and cant wait
                to continue learning. I am really excited to see what the future may hold!
